# Book-Search-MERN

## Description

For this project, I had to take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API and refactor it to be a GRAPHQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN STACK, with a REACT front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It was set up to allow users to save book searches on the back end as well.


To complete this project, I did the following:

1. Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data.

2. Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

3. Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.

4. Deploy the application to Heroku with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas.
